Description: This package has three main functions including MPlot, Demonstrate, and Demonstrate2. The MPlot function uses output from a GWAS 
    tool to create a Manhattan Plot where the -log of the pvalue is plotted by genetic distance and effect size. Gray points represent SNPs that 
    were found to not be significant and all colored pionts represent significant SNPs. The function Demonstrate creates graphs from Winnow output
    in which the population structure is known. Demonstrate2 also uses Winnow output, but is used when population structure data is not available. 
Depends: R (>= 3.2.1)
